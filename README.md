# Welcome to Pokemon List App!

## Introduction
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Installation

First, download and extract my zip file to your local machine then use Terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows) and go to your unzipped folder above

Run 
```bash
npm install

# or

bun install
```
Last, open another Terminal /Command Prompt in the same project directory. Start the NextJS server with this command:

```bash
npm  run  dev

# or

bun  run dev
```
Now you can access the project by using this URL on your browser: http://localhost:3000/
I worked on this project on Sunday. I didn't work on it continuously as it was interrupted by household chores, but the estimated time to complete it was nearly 3 hours.
